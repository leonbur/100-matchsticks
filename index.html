                    <b>How to play:</b>
                    There are 100 matches on the table. A player, on their turn, burns up to 10 matches (and at least 1
                    match).
                    The winner is the player that burns the final match.

                    <b>About this game:</b>
                    My brother introduced me to programming when I was very little. 
                    He coded this game in it's text version in Turbo Pascal for school and I got to sit around and watch the magic happens (and even make suggestions!).
                    His old code is long lost so I decided to recreate the game for his 41st birthday.

                    (And, learn a bit of basic JavaScript on the way.)
