        <b>How to play:</b><br>
        There are 100 matches on the table. A player, on their turn, burns up to 10 matches (and at least 1
        match).
        The winner is the player that burns the final match.

        <b>About this game:</b><br>
        My brother introduced me to programming when I was very little.
        He coded this game in it's text version in Turbo Pascal for school and I got to sit around and watch the magic
        happens (and even make suggestions!).
        His old code is long lost so I decided to recreate the game for his 41st birthday.

        (And, learn a bit of basic JavaScript on the way.)
