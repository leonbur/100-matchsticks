# 100 Matchsticks

## About
A simple math game for schoolkids.
Written in pure JS (Canvas).

## How to play
There are 100 matches on the table. A player, on their turn, burns up to 10 matches (and at least 1
match).
The winner is the player that burns the final match.

## Motivation
1. A nostalgic birthday gift to my older brother who introduced me to programming.
2. Get a basic feeling on doing some HTML/CSS/JS and Canvas.
